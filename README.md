OpenEmbedded BSP layer for DH electronics i.MX platforms
========================================================

This layer provides BSP for DH electronics i.MX platforms.

# Dependencies
--------------

This layer depends on:

* URI: git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky
  - branch: dunfell
  - layers: meta

* URI: https://source.denx.de/denx/meta-mainline-common.git
  - branch: dunfell-3.1

# Building image
----------------

The OE build of this layer can be set up either manually or automatically using
the [KAS](https://github.com/siemens/kas) tool. Both options yield equal result.
The manual option is more flexible, the kas option is easier for starters.

## Building image (kas)
-----------------------

The [KAS](https://github.com/siemens/kas) tool downloads select OE layers, emits
matching bblayers.conf and local.conf, sets up required OE build variables and
even executes the build. The tool also provides menu-based build configuration.

A good starting point for setting up the build using KAS is the KAS documentation,
namely [Introduction](https://kas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html),
[User Guide](https://kas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/userguide.html),
[Command line usage](https://kas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command-line.html) and
[Environment variables](https://kas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command-line.html#environment-variables).

First, install KAS to current user local bin directory:

```
$ pip3 install kas
```
Second, clone this metalayer git repository into a location accessible to the build system:

```
git clone https://github.com/dh-electronics/meta-dhsom-imx-bsp.git -b dunfell-3.1
```

Third, configure the build parameters, especially the work directory where the
build stores all the data. This directory must have sufficient amount of space,
around 25 GiB for basic build and 100 GiB for build with all examples.

The `kas menu` command displays an ncurses-based menu, which offers selection of
one of MACHINEs supported by this metalayer and the option to perform full build
including [meta-dhsom-extras](https://github.com/dh-electronics/meta-dhsom-extras)
example and demonstration layer. Select suitable MACHINE (use SPACEBAR to change
the selection), optionally enable full build (takes longer and requires extra
disk space), and use either `Save & Build` or `Save & Exit` button to save
changes and exit the menu (use TAB key to navigate the buttons).

```
$ export KAS_WORK_DIR=/path/to/work/directory/
$ cd meta-dhsom-imx-bsp/kas
$ PATH=${PATH}:~/.local/bin kas menu
```

The `*** Inferred and expert settings ***` section does not need to be changed.

The `Save & Build` button stores the build configuration in `${KAS_WORK_DIR}/.config.yaml`
and immediately triggers default build target for the selected configuration.
The `Save & Exit` button stores the build configuration and exits, the KAS build
can then be resumed using KAS [build](https://kas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command-line.html#build)
command, `kas build`.

## Building image (manual)
--------------------------

A good starting point for setting up the build environment is is the official
Yocto Project wiki.

* https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/3.1/brief-yoctoprojectqs/brief-yoctoprojectqs.html

Before attempting the build, the following metalayer git repositories shall
be cloned into a location accessible to the build system and a branch listed
below shall be checked out. The examples below will use /path/to/OE/ as a
location of the metalayers.

* https://source.denx.de/denx/meta-mainline-common.git			(branch: dunfell-3.1)
* https://github.com/dh-electronics/meta-dhsom-imx-bsp.git		(branch: dunfell-3.1)
* git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky					(branch: dunfell)

With all the source artifacts in place, proceed with setting up the build
using oe-init-build-env as specified in the Yocto Project wiki.

In addition to the content in the wiki, the aforementioned metalayers shall
be referenced in bblayers.conf in this order:

```
BBLAYERS ?= " \
  /path/to/OE/poky/meta \
  /path/to/OE/meta-mainline-common \
  /path/to/OE/meta-dhsom-imx-bsp \
  "
```

The following specifics should be placed into local.conf:

```
MACHINE = "dh-imx6-dhcom-pdk2"
DISTRO = "nodistro"
```

Note that MACHINE must be either of:

* dh-imx6-dhcom-pdk2

Adapt the suffixes of all the files and names of directories further in
this documentation according to MACHINE.

Both local.conf and bblayers.conf are included verbatim in full at the end
of this readme.

Once the configuration is complete, a basic demo system image suitable for
evaluation can be built using:

```
$ bitbake core-image-minimal
```

Once the build completes, the images are available in:

```
tmp-glibc/deploy/images/dh-imx6-dhcom-pdk2/
```

The SD card image is specifically in:

```
core-image-minimal-dh-imx6-dhcom-pdk2.wic
```

And shall be written to the SD card using dd:

```
$ dd if=core-image-minimal-dh-imx6-dhcom-pdk2.wic of=/dev/sdX bs=8M
```

### Example local.conf
----------------------
```
MACHINE = "dh-imx6-dhcom-pdk2"
DL_DIR = "/path/to/OE/downloads"
DISTRO ?= "nodistro"
PACKAGE_CLASSES ?= "package_rpm"
EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES = "debug-tweaks"
USER_CLASSES ?= "buildstats image-mklibs image-prelink"
PATCHRESOLVE = "noop"
BB_DISKMON_DIRS = "\
    STOPTASKS,${TMPDIR},1G,100K \
    STOPTASKS,${DL_DIR},1G,100K \
    STOPTASKS,${SSTATE_DIR},1G,100K \
    STOPTASKS,/tmp,100M,100K \
    ABORT,${TMPDIR},100M,1K \
    ABORT,${DL_DIR},100M,1K \
    ABORT,${SSTATE_DIR},100M,1K \
    ABORT,/tmp,10M,1K"
PACKAGECONFIG:append:pn-qemu-native = " sdl"
PACKAGECONFIG:append:pn-nativesdk-qemu = " sdl"
CONF_VERSION = "1"
```

### Example bblayers.conf
-------------------------
```
# LAYER_CONF_VERSION is increased each time build/conf/bblayers.conf
# changes incompatibly
POKY_BBLAYERS_CONF_VERSION = "2"

BBPATH = "${TOPDIR}"
BBFILES ?= ""

BBLAYERS ?= " \
	/path/to/OE/poky/meta \
	/path/to/OE/meta-mainline-common \
	/path/to/OE/meta-dhsom-imx-bsp \
	"
```
